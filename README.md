## Introducing Issue Sensitive Image Captioning (ISIC)

## CUB

Our main experiment's code is under the `cub` folder, referring to the Caltech UC San Diego-Bird dataset.

We have complete evaluation pipeline and interactive jupyter notebook.

## MSCOCO

We have implemented our pragmatic decoder on a very popular state-of-the-art image captioning repo. Even though we do not have
quantitative experiment, we made the code and notebook available so that our Pragmatic caption decoder can be used by other
researchers.
